\section{INTRODUCTION}
\paragraph{}
Herein is contained the \textit{Liber Defensionis}, a fortress of spirit constructed from three ancient foundations: the \textit{Ars Goetia} (The Lesser Key of Solomon), the Babylonian protective rites of the \textit{Udug-\d{h}ul}, and the exorcistic authority of the \textit{Rituale Romanum}.

While these traditions span millennia and vast theological divides, they share a single, immutable principle: the invocation of Supreme Divine Authority to compel the obedience of lesser spiritual entities.

The Goetic system \cite{mathersgoetia1904} is famously known for the conjuration of spirits, yet hidden within its circles and triangles lies a perfect defensive architecture. The magician was never intended to stand naked before the abyss; the system provides the names of compulsion, the seals of binding, and the geometry of containment. This work inverts the summoner's logic: rather than opening a door to call a spirit \textit{in}, we utilize the keys to lock the spirit \textit{out}.

Complementing this geometry is the primal authority of the Babylonian tradition. Drawing from the \textit{En\={u}ma Eli\v{s}}, we utilize the Fifty Names of Marduk. In the ancient \textit{Marduk’s Address to the Demons}, the \textit{\={a}\v{s}ipu} (exorcist) did not merely pray to the god—he \textit{became} the god, speaking with the voice of the one who slew the chaos-dragon Ti\={a}mat.

Finally, we anchor these ancient forms in the spoken authority of the Roman Catholic tradition, utilizing the \textit{Vade Retro Satana} and the \textit{Prayer to St. Michael}, formulas tempered by centuries of liturgical use against spiritual oppression.

	\section{REPULSION}
	\hspace{1cm}{\large Preventing Entry and Establishing Defensive Barriers}
	
	\subsection{The Core Logic}
	\paragraph{}
	The Ars Goetia operates on a hierarchy of names and symbols that assert divine authority over all 72 spirits.  The generalized elements are more powerful than individual spirit sigils because they invoke the source of authority rather than targeting an individual entity.  It is like having a master key instead of 72 separate keys.
	
	\subsection{Universal Names of Compulsion}
	These names from the Goetic conjurations work against all spirits of the hierarchy:
	
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{xltabular}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Function} \\ \hline
		\endfirsthead
		\hline
		\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Function} \\ \hline
		\endhead
		
		TETRAGRAMMATON & Supreme divine authority (YHVH) \\ \hline
		ADONAI & Lordship and mastery \\ \hline
		AGLA & Protective barrier ("Thou art mighty forever, O Lord") \\ \hline
		PRIMEUMATON & First cause?commands origin \\ \hline
		ANAPHAXETON & Binds the hidden and formless \\ \hline
		EHYEH & "I Am" ? self?existent divine presence \\ \hline
		EL & God (generic, universal) \\ \hline
		ON & Being itself \\ \hline
		\caption{Universal Names of Compulsion}
		
	\end{xltabular}
\end{flushleft}

	\subsection{The Circle of Solomon}
	The original Circle of Solomon serves as the primary protective boundary.  Its key elements include:
	
	Outer Ring:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The names EHYEH, KETHER, METATRON (divine name, sephirah, archangel)
		\item Four pentagrams at cardinal points
		\item Tau crosses (T) representing completion and sealing
	\end{itemize}
	Inner Ring:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item TETRAGRAMMATON (YHVH) repeated at quarters
		\item ADONAI inscribed between
	\end{itemize}
	Modification for pure defense: Close all gaps (the original has a {\textquotedblleft}doorway{\textquotedblright} for the spirit
	to perceive the magician). Double the boundary lines.  Add AGLA between each pentagram.
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=0.3\paperwidth,keepaspectratio]{solomon_circle.png}
		\caption{The Circle of Solomon}
		\label{fig:solomoncircle}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{The Triangle of Art (Repulsion Configuration)}
	For repulsion rather than summoning, the triangle's point faces OUTWARD from the protected space.  The three sides bear:
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\paperwidth,keepaspectratio]{solomon_triangle.png}
		\caption{The Triangle of Art}
		\label{fig:solomontriangle}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item PRIMEUMATON (first moving)
		\item ANAPHAXETON (hidden one)
		\item TETRAGRAMMATON (the Name)
	\end{itemize}
	At the three points, inscribe MI-CHA-EL (Michael)---invoking the archangel who cast down rebellious spirits.  At center, place the Hexagram of Solomon containing no specific name, creating a {\textquotedblleft}blank{\textquotedblright} binding that
	affects any entity.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\paperwidth,keepaspectratio]{solomon_hexagram.png}
		\caption{The Hexagram of Solomon}
		\label{fig:solomonhexagram}
		\cite[39]{mathersgoetia1904}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{The Pentagram of Solomon}
	The most powerful generalized symbol in the system.  Originally worn by the magician for protection.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\paperwidth,keepaspectratio]{solomon_pentagram.png}
		\caption{The Pentagram of Solomon}
		\label{fig:solomonpentagram}
		\cite[39]{mathersgoetia1904}
	\end{figure}
	
	Elements:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Five points: The five letters of YHShVH (Yahshuah---the {\textquotedblleft}pentagrammaton{\textquotedblright})
		\item Center: The letters TE-TRA-GRAM-MA-TON arranged in the inner pentagon
		\item Outer ring: ABDIA, BALLATON, BELLONY, HALLIY, HALLIZA, SOLUZEN
	\end{itemize}
	For generalized repulsion: Inscribe on metal (traditionally copper or silver). Wear or mount at thresholds.  The symbol asserts authority over any of the 72 without needing to know which.
	
	\subsection{Combined Form}

	\subsection{Spoken Formula for General Banishment}
	\begin{quotation}
	{\textquotedbl}By TETRAGRAMMATON, ADONAI, AGLA, ON, EL---depart from this place.  By PRIMEUMATON who commands thy
	beginning and ANAPHAXETON who binds thy form---return to the depths appointed unto thee.{\textquotedbl}
	\end{quotation}
	
	
	\bigskip
	
	\clearpage
	\section{ENTRAPMENT}
	\hspace{1cm}{\large Containing What Is Present and Localized}
	
	\subsection{The Triangle of Art (Trap Configuration)}
	For entrapment rather than repulsion, the triangle's point faces INWARD toward the disturbance.  This creates a snare
	that draws in and holds any intrusive entity.
	
	Place the triangle over the affected area (window, mirror, suspected portal). At each corner, drive an iron nail into
	the floor or ground.  Place a small pile of salt at each point.  Light black candles.
	
	Speak the Constraint:
	
	\begin{quotation}
	{\textquotedblleft}By PRIMEUMATON at the North, thy origin is sealed.  By ANAPHAXETON at the West, thy form is bound.  By TETRAGRAMMATON at the East, thy will is subject.  Within this triangle thou art constrained.  Thou canst not flee.  Thou canst not hide.  Thou must answer to the names of power.{\textquotedblright}		
	\end{quotation}
	
	\subsection{The Secret Seal of Solomon}
	This seal from the Goetia was used to constrain spirits inside a brass vessel.  It is already generalized---its power
	forces spirits to submit regardless of their rank or individual nature.
	
	The design:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Concentric circles
		\item Central square containing divine names
		\item Hebrew letters around the perimeter
	\end{itemize}
	For defensive use:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Place beneath the threshold of a space
		\item Inscribe on the lid of a container (to trap)
		\item Carve into a surface where an intrusion is suspected
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{The Brass Vessel (Generalized Trap)}
	The original Goetia describes a brass vessel for containing spirits.  A generalized version:
	
	Construction:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Brass body (copper + zinc alloy)
		\item Lead lid with Secret Seal of Solomon impressed
		\item Iron plate beneath
		\item Interior may contain: mercury in sealed glass, graveyard earth, salt, sulfur
	\end{itemize}
	
	\bigskip
	
	\clearpage
	\section{EXPULSION}
	\hspace{1cm}{\large Driving Out What Is Already Embedded}
	
	\subsection{Identifying the Attachment Type}
	Before expulsion, determine what the entity is attached to:
	
	\begin{flushleft}
		\begin{xltabular}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|}
			\hline
			\textbf{Locational} & \textbf{Object-Bound} & \textbf{Personal} \\ \hline
			\endhead
			Activity in specific areas; doesn't follow people who leave &
			Disturbance centers on item; stops when item removed &
			Follows person; effects persist outside location \\ \hline
			Solution: Space cleansing and reconsecration &
			Solution: Destroy or seal the object &
			Solution: Personal severance ritual \\ \hline
			\caption{Attachment Type}
		\end{xltabular}
	\end{flushleft}
	\subsection{The Three Conjurations}
	The Goetic system escalates through increasingly severe conjurations.  Each level invokes higher powers and threatens
	greater consequences.
	
	\subsubsection{First Conjuration (Command)}
	\begin{quotation}
	{\textquotedblleft}I conjure and command thee, spirit present in this place, by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, by the God who spoke and all was made, who commanded and all was created.  I conjure thee by TETRAGRAMMATON YHVH, who cast Adam from Eden, who brought the Flood upon the world, who consumed Sodom with fire, who parted the Red Sea.  I conjure thee by ADONAI, Lord of all creation, by EHYEH ASHER EHYEH, I Am That I Am, by EL SHADDAI, God Almighty, by ELOHIM GIBOR, God of Strength.  Thou art bound by these names.  Thou shalt not remain where thou art not welcome.  Thou shalt depart unto the place appointed thee.  By what name art thou called? By what authority didst thou enter? I command thee: SPEAK.{\textquotedblright}
	\end{quotation}
	
	\subsubsection{Second Conjuration (Threat)}
	\begin{quote}If resistance or silence, escalate:\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quotation}
	{\textquotedblleft}Spirit, thou hast not obeyed.  I conjure thee now by the dreadful Day of Judgment, by the Sea of Glass before the throne, by the Four Beasts with eyes before and behind, by the fire about the throne, by the holy angels of heaven, by the mighty wisdom of God.  I conjure thee by TETRAGRAMMATON YHVH, by ADONAI, EHYEH, EL, ELOHIM, by SADAY, ZEBAOTH, ELION, by ESCERCHIE, ORISTON, JAH, TETRAGRAMMATON.  If thou dost not obey, I will curse thee unto the depths of the abyss.  I will bind thee in chains of darkness.  I will trip from thee all rank and power.  DEPART.  NOW.  Unto the place from whence thou came.  Return not to this place, nor to any whom I protect.  By AGLA, be GONE.{\textquotedblright}
\end{quotation}
	
	\subsubsection{Third Conjuration (Curse)}
	\begin{quote}Final escalation with the four archangels:\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quotation}
	{\textquotedblleft}Disobedient and obstinate spirit, because thou hast not heeded the words of power, because thou hast defied the names of God, I curse thee in the name of TETRAGRAMMATON.  By ANAPHAXETON, I strip thy hidden protections.  By PRIMEUMATON, I sever thy connection to this place.  By TETRAGRAMMATON, I cast thee out utterly.  MICHAEL stands at the East with sword drawn.  GABRIEL stands at the West with the cup of banishment.  RAPHAEL stands at the South with the winds of driving.  URIEL stands at the North with flames of purification.  There is no quarter for thee.  There is no refuge.  I expel thee by the power of the Most High.  I expel thee by Solomon who bound thy kind.  I expel thee by the Seal that commands thy obedience.  GO.  TETRAGRAMMATON compels thee.  ADONAI compels thee.  AGLA compels thee.  EL.  YAH.  YHVH.  EHYEH.  SADAY.  BE GONE FROM THIS PLACE FOREVER.{\textquotedblright}
\end{quotation}
	
	\subsection{Severance Procedures}
	For Locational Attachment:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Take iron blade or nail
		\item Beginning at center of disturbance, {\textquotedblleft}cut{\textquotedblright} the air in a cross pattern
		\item Speak: {\textquotedblleft}I sever thy tie to this place.{\textquotedblright}
		\item Move to each corner of the room/space, repeat
		\item At threshold, cut horizontally across doorway: {\textquotedblleft}Thy passage here is ended.{\textquotedblright}
	\end{enumerate}
	For Object Attachment:
	
	Option A --- Destruction: Remove object to crossroads or running water.  Break it while speaking: {\textquotedblleft}By TETRAGRAMMATON, I break thy vessel.  By ADONAI, I release thy hold.  By AGLA, I end thy presence.{\textquotedblright} Bury fragments in separate locations or burn and scatter ashes in running water.
	
	Option B --- Sealing: Place in brass vessel with lead lid.  Seal with Secret Seal of Solomon.  Bind with iron chain or wire.  Bury deeply or encase in concrete.
	
	For Personal Attachment:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Person stands in center of Circle of Solomon
		\item Operator works from outside, with hazel wand
		\item Beginning at crown of head, move wand downward: {\textquotedblleft}From thy head, depart.{\textquotedblright}
		\item At throat: {\textquotedblleft}From thy voice, depart.{\textquotedblright}
		\item At heart: {\textquotedblleft}From thy heart, depart.{\textquotedblright}
		\item At hands: {\textquotedblleft}From thy works, depart.{\textquotedblright}
		\item At feet: {\textquotedblleft}From thy path, depart.{\textquotedblright}
		\item Final sweep, head to toe, with full severance declaration
		\item Person is anointed with protective oil and given Pentagram of Solomon to wear
	\end{enumerate}

	\section{THE FIFTY NAMES OF MARDUK}
	\hspace{1cm}{\large Babylonian Divine Authority for Exorcism}
	
	\subsection{Origin and Function}
	The Fifty Names of Marduk derive from the Babylonian creation epic, the {Enuma Elish}{\index{Enuma Elish}} (circa 12th century BCE). These names appear in Tablets VI and VII and represent powers given to Marduk after his victory over the chaos dragon Ti\={a}mat.
	
	These names were used in {\textquotedblleft}Marduk's Address to the Demons,{\textquotedblright} a key section of the ancient Mesopotamian exorcism series Udug-\d{h}ul ({\textquotedblleft}Evil Demons{\textquotedblright}). When performing exorcisms, the exorcist (\=a\v{s}ipu) would essentially become Marduk, speaking in the first person as Asallu\d{h}i/Marduk.
	
	The core principle: By reciting the Fifty Names, the exorcist assumes the identity and authority of Marduk himself---the god who defeated primordial chaos.
