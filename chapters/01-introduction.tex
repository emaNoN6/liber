\section{INTRODUCTION}

This is a working manual, not a historical curiosity.

The spiritual world makes demands on the physical. When those demands become hostile---when a presence refuses to leave, when a space becomes uninhabitable, when something attaches itself to a person or object---words alone do not suffice. What is required is a combination of authority and action: the invocation of powers that supersede the intruding entity, and the physical means to compel its departure.

This grimoire compiles tested methods for three objectives:

\textbf{REPULSION} - Establishing barriers that prevent entry or approach

\textbf{ENTRAPMENT} - Containing what is already present and localized  

\textbf{EXPULSION} - Driving out what has become embedded or attached

The techniques herein derive primarily from three documented traditions, selected not for religious orthodoxy but for operational completeness:

\textbf{The Solomonic System} provides the most comprehensive architecture for defensive geometry, names of compulsion, and hierarchical authority over spiritual entities. The \textit{Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis} in particular contains explicit instructions for circles, triangles, and seals that have been replicated across centuries.

\textbf{The Babylonian Tradition}, specifically the exorcism protocols of the \textit{Udug-\d{h}ul} and the divine names from the \textit{En\={u}ma Eli\v{s}}, demonstrates the mechanism of assumed authority---the exorcist speaking not as petitioner but as the god himself. This is the oldest documented system of its kind.

\textbf{The Roman Catholic Ritual} offers formulas refined through institutional use. The prayers of Leo XIII and the traditional litanies represent centuries of liturgical testing against persistent spiritual opposition.

These are starting points, not limitations. Where folk methods prove effective---salt, iron, specific woods, regional protocols---they are included. Where martial responses become necessary, those too have their place. This manual expands as new methods are documented and verified.

\textbf{The Structure:}

\begin{description}
	\item[PART I: Formal Defensive Protocols] \hfill \\
	Systematic ritual procedures derived from established grimoires and liturgical texts. Currently focused on demonic hierarchies, expandable to other classifications.
	
	\item[PART II: Entity-Specific Responses] \hfill \\
	Identification, engagement protocols, and survival guidelines organized by threat type. [Under development]
	
	\item[PART III: Materials and Methods] \hfill \\
	The practical components: metals, incenses, timing, physical implements, and their specific applications.
	
	\item[APPENDICES] \hfill \\
	Quick-reference procedures, pronunciation guides, emergency protocols, and visual references.
\end{description}

A note on authority: The systems presented here invoke divine names and assume spiritual hierarchies. Whether one views these as literal cosmic structures or as psychological mechanisms of compulsion is irrelevant to their function. What matters is that the practitioner speaks with conviction, follows the procedures precisely, and understands the escalation protocols when initial methods fail.

This is not armchair occultism. These are field procedures. Use them accordingly.
