	\section{ENTRAPMENT}
	\hspace{1cm}{\large Containing What Is Present and Localized}
	
	\subsection{The Triangle of Art (Trap Configuration)}
	For entrapment rather than repulsion, the triangle's point faces INWARD toward the disturbance.  This creates a snare
	that draws in and holds any intrusive entity.
	
	Place the triangle over the affected area (window, mirror, suspected portal). At each corner, drive an iron nail into
	the floor or ground.  Place a small pile of salt at each point.  Light black candles.
	
	Speak the Constraint:
	
	\begin{quotation}
	\enquote{By PRIMEUMATON at the North, thy origin is sealed.  By ANAPHAXETON at the West, thy form is bound.  By TETRAGRAMMATON at the East, thy will is subject.  Within this triangle thou art constrained.  Thou canst not flee.  Thou canst not hide.  Thou must answer to the names of power.}		
	\end{quotation}
	
	\subsection{The Secret Seal of Solomon}
	This seal from the Goetia was used to constrain spirits inside a brass vessel.  It is already generalized---its power
	forces spirits to submit regardless of their rank or individual nature.
	
	The design:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Concentric circles
		\item Central square containing divine names
		\item Hebrew letters around the perimeter
	\end{itemize}
	For defensive use:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Place beneath the threshold of a space
		\item Inscribe on the lid of a container (to trap)
		\item Carve into a surface where an intrusion is suspected
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{The Brass Vessel (Generalized Trap)}
	The original Goetia describes a brass vessel for containing spirits.  A generalized version:
	
	Construction:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Brass body (copper + zinc alloy)
		\item Lead lid with Secret Seal of Solomon impressed
		\item Iron plate beneath
		\item Interior may contain: mercury in sealed glass, graveyard earth, salt, sulfur
	\end{itemize}
